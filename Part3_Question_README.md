 - For automated stock collections, the code will run using a cron job that is set to update for every 24 hours. The cron function will get the latest response from the stock's API, and will execute a script that returns a data that will be stored on an SQL database. It will be inserted together with the previous history of stock collections data. It will also allow users to read collections of data, so that they can retrieve it and use it for reports.

 - If an error occurs on the part of insertion of data, it will automatically catch the error's response and will be accessible on an error-logging file. Fault tolerance will be part of the flow as well. Services that are dependent with the automated stock collections will still run continuously.
